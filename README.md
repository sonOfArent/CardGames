# CardGames

This is the current big project I am working on. The current plans:

# TODO
- Several card games, fully playable inside the python console.
- "Bots" (Really just slightly more complex functions) that can play these games.
- Results from these games will be stored in a SQL database, linked to a player login.
- A stats website built with Django that can be used to access the players and records.

# DONE
